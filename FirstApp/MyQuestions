Why some files are named as module in angular?
How all the typescript files get called up and get executed?


The core and platform-browser comes from the folder node-modules/@angular
The ts file that has @NgModule seems likes the starting file for the app.
The local ts file can used to import their respective class.

so to use class AppComponent, from file app.component.ts
the statement will be
import { AppComponent } from './app.component'
