You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  C:\Rahul\Angular\Classes\Angular-master\23rdClass\deployment-finished

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are currently outside your home directory
  * You are initializing in an existing Firebase project directory

? Are you ready to proceed? Yes
? Which Firebase CLI features do you want to set up for this folder? Press Space to select features, then Enter to confirm your choices. Database: Deploy Firebase Realtime Database Rules, Hosting: Configure and deploy Firebase Hosting sites


=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

i  .firebaserc already has a default project, using ng-course-recipe-book-65f10.

Error: Failed to get Firebase project ng-course-recipe-book-65f10. Please make sure the project exists and your account has permission to access it.

structured and when your data can be read from and written to.

? What file should be used for Database Rules? database.rules.json
+  Database Rules for angular-starter-a7675 have been downloaded to database.rules.json.
Future modifications to database.rules.json will update Database Rules when you run
firebase deploy.

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? dist
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
? File dist/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No
i  Skipping write of dist/index.html
